# GTP-3
Building on GPT-3 from OpenAI.

The window.py file opens up a window on your screen that allows for customized usage of GPT-3 in a rough interface. It is required to fill in your personal API-key in gpt3.py for usage of the application. There is currently a predictive text completion function that works by the TAB and ESCAPE keybinds.
